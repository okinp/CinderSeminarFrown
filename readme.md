# Cinder Seminar @ Frown

## OS X

In order to compile the code, we first need to change a user defined setting named "CINDER_PATH",
that can be found in each project's Build Settings and is shown below: 

![Cinder Path](/readmeAssets/CINDER_PATH.png) 

In there, we must put the relative path that takes us from the location of the .xcodeproj to the Cinder folder that is shown below:

![Cinder Folder](/readmeAssets/CinderFolder.png) 

You might also need to change the Base SDK

and the deployment target

to correspond to the ones installed in your computer.


## Windows 

Currently in these tutorials Windows & Visual Studio are not supported.
